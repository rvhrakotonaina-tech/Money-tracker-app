1. **Deterministic Financial Engine**: Kotlin performs all arithmetic, income/expense totals, net balance calculations, category grouping, and savings goal feasibility checks.
2. **Intent Routing**: Deterministic financial queries (e.g., *"What is my largest expense?"* or *"How much did I spend on Food?"*) are answered directly by Kotlin in 0ms with 100% precision.
3. **Natural Language Explanation**: For conversational advice, Kotlin constructs a structured **Financial Facts Context** and passes it to the local Qwen model for concise natural-language explanations.
